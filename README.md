We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [AWS IAM Authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html)




## What Includes

- [Autoscale](modules/autoscale/README.md)
- [EKS](modules/eks/README.md)
- [Worker](modules/worker/README.md)






## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-eks/releases).


### Sample example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
module "eks-cluster" {
source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-eks.git?ref=tags/0.12.6"

## Tags
name        = "eks"
application = "clouddrove"
environment = "test"
label_order = ["environment", "application", "name"]
enabled     = true


## Network
vpc_id                          = module.vpc.vpc_id
eks_subnet_ids                  = module.subnets.public_subnet_id
worker_subnet_ids               = module.subnets.private_subnet_id
allowed_security_groups_cluster = []
allowed_security_groups_workers = []
additional_security_group_ids   = [module.ssh.security_group_ids]
endpoint_private_access         = false
endpoint_public_access          = true

## Ec2
key_name      = module.keypair.name
image_id      = "ami-0dd0a16a2bd0784b8"
ondemand_instance_type = "t3.small"
max_size      = 3
min_size      = 1
volume_size   = 20

## Spot
spot_enabled  = true
spot_max_size = 3
spot_min_size = 1

max_price                   = "0.20"
spot_instance_type          = "m5.large"
associate_public_ip_address = true

## Cluster
wait_for_capacity_timeout = "15m"
apply_config_map_aws_auth = true
kubernetes_version        = "1.14"

## Schedule
scheduler_down          = "0 19 * * MON-FRI"
scheduler_up            = "0 6 * * MON-FRI"

schedule_enabled        = true
schedule_min_size_scaledown      = 0
schedule_max_size_scaledown      = 1
scale_up_desired        = 2
scale_down_desired      = 1

spot_schedule_enabled   = true
schedule_spot_min_size_scaledown = 0
schedule_spot_max_size_scaledown = 1
spot_scale_up_desired   = 2
spot_scale_down_desired = 1


## Health Checks
cpu_utilization_high_threshold_percent = 80
cpu_utilization_low_threshold_percent  = 20
health_check_type                      = "EC2"

## EBS Encryption
ebs_encryption = false

## logs
enabled_cluster_log_types = ["api", "audit", "authenticator", "controllerManager", "scheduler"]
  }
 ```









## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
